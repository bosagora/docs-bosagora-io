In Bosagora, the nodes comprise the blockchain which is called *Agora*. In early blockchains, like Bitcoin, the nodes are responsible for enforcing the consensus algorithm and storing the blocks and not much more. The nodes in Agora have other responsibilities and opportunities.

Node operators in Agora can join *The Congress Network*. The Congress Network, which follows the rule of one node-one vote, is a way for the nodes in the network to participate in democratic decision-making with regard to the evolution of the network.

Nodes operators in Agora also get to participate in the decision-making of how to provision the *Commons Budgets*. The Common Budget is a fund of BOA cryptocurrency which is used for system upgrades and any other proposal which benefits the entire Bosagora ecosystem.

In addition to decision making opportunities, members of The Congress Network also have financial incentives in the form of BOA rewards. There are two ways for members of The Congress Network to receive BOA rewards: confirmation rewards and transaction fees.

Confirmation rewards are given to a node operator when a block is confirmed. Transaction fees are applied to all transactions and consist of a **fixed** transaction fee (i.e., itâ€™s the same amount for all transactions) and a **data** fee which is proportional to the size of the transaction data (i.e., larger data transactions cost more).

To run a node and receive an incentive as an validator, one must freeze some BOA tokens. The frozen tokens funtion as a security deposit against an attempt to forge the blockchain. In other words, if a node tries to forge the blockchain, some of the frozen tokens will be confiscated and sent to the Commons Budget account.

Anyone who fulfills the following conditions can become a member of The Congress Network:

* Freeze at least 40,000 BOA and forgo liquidity
* Operate a full node at a stable network speed (operate in a server or personal computer)

The members of The Congress Network can set nodes in two directions depending on their goals: 

* Operating a greater number of nodes increases their voting power
* Accumlating BOA tokens in a single node reduces node operating costs
