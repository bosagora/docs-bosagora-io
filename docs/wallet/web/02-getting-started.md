You can start your wallet by entering a secret key or public key and the name of your account, 
and then by pressing the button "OK". 
If you don't have a secret key or a public key, you can generate a new key by pressing the button "Create". 
The web wallet does not keep the secret key generated here. 
you must enter a secret key when logging back into the web wallet. 
If you haven't backed your secret key up, 
you won't be able to use the funds transferred to the account, so be extra careful.  
A detailed description of the account is provided in [Manage accounts](./01-introduction.md#manage-accounts).

## Menu
All screens have menus on the left. 
The menu includes Overview, Transactions history, 
Send BOA, Create Validator, Unfreezing, Store Data, Contact List, and Settings.

**Overview**

You can see the last 10 completed transactions and pending transactions of the selected account here.

**Transactions History**

You can see past transactions of the selected account here. 

**Send BOA**

You can transfer funds from here to another account.

**Create Validator**

At least 40,000 BOA must be frozen to create a validator node in BOASGORA's network. 
You can freeze the funds here. In this process, additional keypairs are created for node operation. 
This key pair is used to set up nodes.

**Unfreezing**

The ability to release frozen funds is provided to create a validator. 

**Store Data**

You can store data in the blockchain here. 

**Contact List**

The contact list is an address book that contains the addresses frequently used when transferring. 
Contacts make it easy for users to select addresses when transferring. 
Therefore, you can easily distinguish transaction details 
by the contact name registered in the contact list instead of the other party's address.

**Setting**

You can set network, language, time zone, etc. here.

**Account selection**

You can choose one of several registered accounts.
You can also copy the public key of the account, delete the account, and add a new account.

**Network selection**

There are two networks in BOSAGORA.: CoinNet and TestNet. 
CoinNet is a network in which actual coins with value are transmitted. 
TestNet is used to test the networks and the coins here do not have actual value.

**Balance**

The web wallet shows two types of balance: the balance of the selected account, and the sum of all registered accounts
In addition, the balance can be subdivided into the following. 

* Total balance : This is the sum of all UTXO held by the account. 
* Spendable balance: This is the sum of UTXO that can be spent on the account. 
* Frozen balance : The sum of the frozen UTXO. 
* Locked balance : This is the sum of UTXO that cannot be used for a certain period.   
There are two types of locked balances. 
The first is that the frozen UTXO is unfrozen, 
and the newly created UTXO is locked until 2016 new blocks are created. 
The second is the amount of UTXO used for the pending transaction. 
The UTXO consumed in the transaction is locked until the block containing it is externalized.

**Mode status**

The public key must be registered in your account, 
but the secret key may not be registered. 
The mode of the account where the secret key is registered is Sudo. 
The mode of the account where the secret key isn't registered is ReadOnly. 
The web wallet shows the number of Sudo, 
making it easy for you to figure out the number of secret keys registered on the web wallet.
