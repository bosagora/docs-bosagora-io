# BOA Wallet Guide

This document describes the different wallet options that are available to users of BOSAGORA who want to be able to send, receive and interact with BOA coins on the BOSAGORA blockchain.

## What is a Wallet?

Wallet is an application that can be used to store accounts and transmit, receive, and track cryptocurrencies.

An account consists of a public key, a secret key, and a name.
The public key and the secret key are called key pairs.
The public key is also used as the address of the account.

The public key may be shared and displayed freely.
When the other party sends a certain amount of cryptocurrency to the account, you need to know the account's receiving address.
The public key can also be used to view specific information about your account, such as viewing balances, but there is no function to change or withdraw coins from your account.

The secret key is used to sign all transactions that send or change cryptocurrency to another address. You can never share a secret key.
If someone gains access to a secret key to an account, they can withdraw all the coins it contains.
If the secret key for an account is lost, any coins that have been sent to that account's address are permanently lost.
